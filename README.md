# Background
The Happy Valley Bank in Hong Kong (unrelated to the Silicon Valley Bank which has been on the news recently) is working on a marketing campaign to promote a new saving deposit subscription plan to their own clients. The marketing campaign, like some of those done before, are to be based on phone calls as much as possible. Experience shows that they probably need more than one contact with the same clients, hence some are contacted more than once.
The bank has collected anonymized data of their clients whom they have previously contacted by the relationship manager, some with previous similar campaigns, or on other banking businesses. As the bank’s data analysis department, your team is asked to make use of the dataset to predict if the client will subscribe (or not subscribe) to the new term saving deposit plan in order to inform the bank’s management executive.
